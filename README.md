Math 115AH at UCLA (Dr. Jens Eberhardt, Winter 2019)

A place to hold all my digitized notes (and helps to keep me accountable).

Typed up in LaTeX, output to .pdf

These are notes taken from lecture, which in turn are "loosely based upon <strong>S. Friedberg, et al, Linear Algebra, Custom UCLA 4th Ed., Prentice Hall" </strong>.
